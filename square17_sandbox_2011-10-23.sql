Place the pan of extra stuffing in the oven during the last 15 minutes of meat cooking time. Bake both for 15 minutes, then remove foil from the stuffing pan. \nCheck the internal temperature of the stuffing in the crown roast or turkey. It should be 160 degrees F when tested with an instant-read thermometer. If the stuffing is not the proper temperature, continue checking at 10-minute intervals. The extra stuffing is done when it has firmed up and is lightly toasted on top, about 40 to 50 minutes total.

Sprinkle salt, pepper, and paprika over top and sides of bird. Rub spices into skin. Do not season inside or bottom of turkey. \nPlace all stuffing into cavity. (If there\'s any extra, place it on a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap it completely to make a pouch. Place in pan with turkey.) Place a meat thermometer into thickest part of breast, without touching the bone. Use a large sheet of foil to make a tent over turkey. Roast turkey at 325 &deg;F for 2 1/2 hours. \nRemove foil and check temperature. Check turkey again at 45-minute intervals until internal temperature reaches 170 &deg;F.
